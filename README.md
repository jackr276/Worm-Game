# Worm Game: A Slither.io-like game

Authors: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276) and [Randall Tarazona](https://github.com/Randall543)

## Introduction
Our project idea came from webgame slither.io, which was very popular in the mid-2010s. Just like in slither.io, the player starts off as a worm, or snake, and the goal of the game is to consume particles using the worm. As particles are consumed, the snake grows in length and your score goes up. There is no specific victory condition for the game, but there is a loss condition. If, at any time, any one of the external "food" particles hits the worm's body, the game is over. Since the worm's size keeps growing, a collision is inevitable, so there is some degree of luck involved in getting a high score. For a more in-depth explanation, I would encourage you to watch the video demonstration below.
